3. Download FFMPEG software on your local machine & find path of installation
```javascipt
// MacOS
brew install ffmpeg
which ffmpeg

// LINUX
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
which ffmpeg
```

4. Inside Index.js set the above found path to FFMPEG_PATH, also set HOST variable to where your backend will be hosted, this path is used in segment playlists.
```javascipt
const HOST = 'http://localhost'
const PORT = 3000;
const FFMPEG_PATH = '/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg';  // Locally installed ffmpeg application path
```
